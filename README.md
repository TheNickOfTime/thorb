# THORB

This project was created over several months by a group of Naughty Dog QA Members in our free time outside of work - we called this effort the "NDQA Game Chill." The goal was to produce a higher quality project, over a longer period of time compared to a game jam. The goal was also to avoid the negative effects one might experience in a game jam - losing sleep, time-crunch stress/anxiety, poor work/life balance, etc.

While we did have to adapt our original timeline for the project (to accommodate a proper work/life balance while shipping "The Last of Us: Part 1"), we successfully finished work on the project while sticking to our original guidelines for the project - no crunch, no stress, voluntary commitment. Everyone that worked on this project successfully challenged their knowledge and skills, and the end result is something greater than we could have achieved on our own. Please Enjoy!

### Source Code Disclaimer
If you are here looking at the source code, and have any intent to download/use it, please consider the following:
* This repo was migrated from Subversion to Git
* Due to GitHub limitations (and to not have this repo be 20+ gigs) any unused files were removed, and then deleted from version control history
* Even then, in order to comply with GitHub's 100mb file limit, a few more additional in-use files had to be removed

All of this is to say, if there are issues, I'm not surprised! Please reach out to Nick if you are at all interested in a more pristine source copy.
